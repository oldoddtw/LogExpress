## Why LogExpress?
More than 70% of Taiwan's GDP is generated by the semiconductor and electronics industry. In these fields where yield is the primary indicator, there isn't a strict regulatory requirement, but there is a high demand for automation and system integration. Surprisingly, most enterprises are not that 'high-tech' in their data recording methods. "Drop to Cursor" is considered an advanced method for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the data collection solutions on the market are either too complex or too simple and lack flexibility. Users generally lack a steppingstone to drive the process of data management. I often spend a lot of time helping users handle basic connections and data acquisition works, but they are still not satisfied with the existing software or solutions.
<br><br>
As a tool software oriented by end-user daily needs and specially designed for small and medium-sized instrument owners, LogExpress simultaneously captures data from METTLER balances, pH meters and moisture analyzers with one interface on PC and stores it in the same database. It's useful functions and high scalability can help disadvantaged users who are uncertain about the direction of data management, lack budget or IT capabilities, play a guiding and supportive role. For mid-to-high-end enterprises, it can be used as a transition tool to stabilize them before introducing high-end system, especially for most companies who are still stay in the stage of hybrid system. 
<br><br>
Based on respecting users' choices and investment costs, LogExpress has established basic information for nearly 500 models, allowing for quick identification of models and a seamless transition to usage. From older to newer, from entry-level to high-end models, users can easily manage their devices and leverage the cost-effectiveness of METTLER instruments. This not only satisfies owners but also prevents resource waste and protects our environment.
<br><br>
LogExpress is developed according to decades of experiences and industry requirements, aiming to align with industry practices and regulatory requirements as much as possible. But after all, it is a shared software developed by individual in my spare time. If you have any ideas for debugging, improvement, feature expansion, or any other suggestions, please feel free to contact me at any time. I would greatly appreciate your valuable feedback.

## Language
- Driven by the idea of public contribution and the hope to help more grassroots users, this system comes with a built-in 52 languages vocabulary database and special bilingual function to achieve better localization through a friendly interface. For detailed information, please refer to the documents in the [01_Language_语言] folder.
- Thanks to Google Translate, it brings people closer. However, because the initial versions of each language in the database come from machine translation, there must be errors or inappropriate problems. If you are willing to make corrections and improvements to anyone language, I would greatly appreciate your support.
